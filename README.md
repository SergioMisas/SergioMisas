# Hello there!! Im not General Kenobi though ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sergio Misas (he/him) and I am currently studing a Multiplatform Application Development professional training at [IES-LUIS-VIVES](https://www.iesluisvives.es/).

Not only am I studying this, but I also have spent 4 years studying a chemistry degree at [UCM](https://quimicas.ucm.es/)

And last but not least I have achieved the [C2 Cambridge English certificate](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKv6-AMFcTc/) on September of 2020 (I received my certificate later)

I will upload all my proyects, exercises and exams here so you can take a look.

Also I think my octocat really represents me, take a look!
